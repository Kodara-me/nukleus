# Contributing to Kira Service

Kira Service is a C++20 Qt 6 project. Build dependencies are CMake, Ninja, a C++20 compiler, and Qt 6.2+ Network, WebSockets, and Widgets development packages. `sd-cli` is only required on a machine that performs image work.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Run the daemon with `./build/src/kira-service`. Run the local administrator UI with `./build/src/kira-service-manager`. Use the root installer only for Linux systemd deployments.

Keep protocol v3 compatible with existing Canvas clients. Do not create an inter-repository library; update the protocol document and each local implementation together.
